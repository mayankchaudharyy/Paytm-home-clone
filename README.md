# Paytm

Aha, gotcha!!!
**Paytm** We fixed Home Page of your website😁
I made a clone of the Paytm home page using Tailwind and official Paytm website having an issue with responsive design so I fixed it in my clone and it took me more than 10 hours to make that clone. Working with Tailwind was quite fun and I learned so many things. Here is a brief explanation of what I did. I started by creating a basic HTML structure and then adding the Tailwind CSS classes. Breakpoints can be named in the script, so you can reference them in your HTML element class with a tailwind, which will help you in responsive design. so you can create complex responsive designs. Overall, working with Tailwind was a great experience. we can make the responsive design much easier and faster.
